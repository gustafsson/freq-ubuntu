---------
The portaudio19-dev package conflicts with skype (indirectly through dependant packages, i.e libjack0).
You may eaither install portaudio19-dev and remove skype (or install skype some other way) or use these precompiled binaries (or compile portaudio19-dev yourself).

jack, oss, alsa and asihpi support will be built if they are available and can be auto-detected.
libjack-dev can't be installed because it requires libjack0. See above.
oss is included in the kernel.
asihpi, dunno.
sudo apt-get install libclalsadrv-dev
